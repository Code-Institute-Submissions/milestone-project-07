As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

### Design Choices
Your site is most likely geared to a certain audience and your design choices should tie into them. Let the assessors know your thought process.
You may want to re-watch the videos about the [5 planes of UX development ](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/9c295bdc5a4048308460e262b14ab7df/) when writing up this section

#### Colors
The main inspiration of the colors started from the Oxford Blue color. 
By the [empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com website](https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/blue-in-business.html#:~:text=Blue%20is%20the%20most%20universally,indicates%20confidence%2C%20reliability%20and%20responsibility.) 
"Blue is the most universally favored color of all and therefore the safest to use. It relates to trust, honesty and dependability, therefore helping to build customer loyalty. Blue indicates confidence, reliability and responsibility"
- As a major color, the Oxford Blue (#0A0E29) is responsible to create a trust feeling from an employer to a potential employee. 
- Space Cadet (#2D325A) is a same blue group color and gives a variety and lighter shade. 
- Secondary color is Imperial Red (#F71735). As a shade of red, gives us feeling of energy, passion and action. Itâ€™s important to show a creativity and energy for a potential employer. 
- Accent color is Gold Metallic (#DBB13B). As a shade of yellow should create a feeling of success, achievement and triumph. 
- Pale Purple Pantone (#F1E4F3) color is a neutral and combines all colors together
- Combination of those colors should create emotional trust and future potential. Those feelings and website content should help the Author to achieve his goals to be hired.

#### Images
Explain why you used certain icons and images on your site

#### Design Elements
- list out the type of elements you want to use on your site, this will help you  when choosing a framework and goes hand in hand when doing the wireframes. If you did something out of the ordinary, or think something was particularly clever, add a sentence and a screen shot or reference the file the code or css is in.
- top menu (desktop navigation)
- sidebar menu (mobile navigation)
- footer
- containers/cards
- buttons
- text input
- textarea inputs
- dropdowns

### Wireframes
- This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. 
that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), 
or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Features

It's easiest to break this section down into the header, footer, layer, and each page of your website. Call out any differences for mobile vs desktop presentations, include a screenshot.
Don't forget your 404 error page.

#### Future Features
Use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
